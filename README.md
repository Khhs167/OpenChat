# OpenChat - Open Source room-based chatting
Welcome to OpenChat! I put this project together in like 2 days so don't expect anything big!  

I am still looking for a way to host this so that i can test it online tho.  

I am fine with PRs but don't expect much from me.

## Running
You need:
- NodeJS
- npm
- A Computer
- Optional: git

### Downloading via git
Git downloads are the easiest, if you ask me.
It is literally one command.
```
git clone https://github.com/Khhs167/OpenChat.git
```

### Downloading via GitHub
So, just to to that little code icon in the corner next to the "+" on github, and under "local" click "Download ZIP", then extract the files to disk.

### Running
Navigate into the directory with this file in it, and open it in a terminal.  
On first download, do
```
npm install
```
Then on all other runs(including the first one) do
```
node .
```
To actually run the project.
